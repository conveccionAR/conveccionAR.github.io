Likewise, the study of these events requires intensive observations, and since 2012 I have been involved in the design, development, fundraising and implementation of the RELAMPAGO-CACTI campaign as principal investigator (PI) for Argentina together with a group of researchers from Argentina, Brazil and the United States. Since 2016 I actively participate in the Nowcasting and Mesoscale Research group of the World Weather Research Program of the World Meteorological Organization and since 2020 I am co-chair of the group. Together with the Societal and Economic Research Applications working group, we have developed the programme on capabilities in nowcasting techniques and early warning systems of the World Weather Services.\n\n\nEducation\n\nMSci.

A regionally standardised and quality-controlled database is essential to understand the regional atmospheric conditions that favour extreme weather events and to build robust early warning systems in a context of climate change adaptation.\nhttps://samhi.cima.fcen.uba.ar/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNMR-SERA\n\nThe Nowcasting and Mesoscale Research (NMR) and the Societal Economic Research Applications (SERA) Working Groups from the WMO World Weather Research Programme (WWRP) are working together to evaluate nowcasting systems available in the different WMO Regional Associations, with a particular focus on developing countries, and types of warnings generated on severe weather as well as the way information is communicated to decision-makers and users. This activity is concentrated on evaluating techniques applied to develop severe weather warning systems on phenomena such as hail, strong winds, thunderstorms and tornadoes in developing countries.\n\n\nNMR WG and SERA WG stress the importance of interdisciplinary research as a fundamental tool to evaluate and understand the needs and requirements of both the scientific community and end-users of warnings.\nThe main objectives are to evaluate access to radar, satellite and lightning data, nowcasting techniques and severe weather warning systems available in developing countries as well as promote a set of best practices in order to improve severe weather warning systems. Information was collected through a survey answered by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of each country in different WMO Regional Associations during 2021 and 2022, and with support of EUMETNET Nowcasting Programme.\nhttps://wwrp-nowcastingcapabilities.com/about-us/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELAMPAGO-CACTI\n\nRELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations)\nCACTI (Clouds, Aerosols, and Complex Terrain Interactions)\nJune 2018 – April 2019\nhttps://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/relampago\n\n\nRELAMPAGO was a major field campaign conducted in the Córdoba and Mendoza provinces in Argentina and western Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil in 2018–19 that involved more than 200 scientists and students from the United States, Argentina, and Brazil. This campaign was motivated by the physical processes and societal impacts of deep convection that frequently initiates in this region, often along the complex terrain of the Sierras de Córdoba and Andes, and often grows rapidly upscale into dangerous storms that impact society. Observed storms during the experiment produced copious hail, intense flash flooding, extreme lightning flash rates, and other unusual lightning phenomena, but few tornadoes. The five distinct scientific foci of RELAMPAGO—convection initiation, severe weather, upscale growth, hydrometeorology, and lightning and electrification—are described, as are the deployment strategies to observe physical processes relevant to these foci. The campaign’s international cooperation, forecasting efforts, and mission planning strategies enabled a successful data collection effort. In addition, the legacy of RELAMPAGO in South America, including extensive multinational education, public outreach, and social media data gathering associated with the campaign, is summarized. Similarly, CACTI was RELAMPAGO’s sister project, funded by the U.S.A Department of Energy (DOE). CACTI stands for ‘Clouds, Aerosols, Complex Terrain Interactions’ campaign - which took an integrated and expansive observational approach."
